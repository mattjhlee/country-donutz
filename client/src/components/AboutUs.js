            <p>Our story began in 2017, when the owner Reggie Earl and his nephew Lang Leng decided to invest in a small family business. As a Cambodian refugee, Reggie had to immigrate to America in order to support his family. Reggie resided in Long Beach, California, and noticed the many Cambodian-owned donut shops scattered throughout Southern California. Reggie then got inspired to open his own donut shop on the east coast located in Salisbury, North Carolina.</p>

            <p>Reggie Earl wants to bring daily fresh doughnuts and a taste of the Southern California atmosphere to his local shop, but what is that exactly? Itâ€™s the bright pink boxes combined with the boba drinks. So far, the pink box is a symbol of doughnuts typically found in Los Angeles, a city that has become an epicenter of doughnut culture in recent decades; Reggie is hoping that it will catch on in North Carolina. </p>
